                        IOP for Zero over K batched arguments
                            without linearisation

                P                                                           V

Round1:          

a. Collect a SET of all different queries 
by iterating queries of virtual oracles

b. Assign matching rotations to each concrete oracle

b. Mask(if needed) witness oracles with
degree = num_of_different_rotations

d. commit to all witness oracles [W] 
            
                    --------> send commitments to [W] <--------     
                                                                        
                                                                    a. sample separation challenge
                    
                    --------> send separation challenge <--------

Round2: 

a. compute degree Q_DEG = of qoutient polynomial as 
max(vo.compute_degree for vo in virtual_oracles) - degree of vanishing poly

b. compute extension domain given Q_DEG

c. compute evals_at_coset_of_extended_domain for each oracle

d. instantiate quotient by instantiating each of the oracles
and separating them with separation_challenge

e. split quotient on chunks of srs_size, [Qi]
// TODO: consider aslo blinding quotient (recent plonk bug)

d. commit [Qi]

                        --------> send commitments to [Qi] <--------
                                                                                a. sample evaluation challenge



Round 3:

Compute batched openings at each w * evaluation_challenge
For each concrete oracle we store queries made to it's possible to map 
how to batch concrete oracles


                        --------> send commitments to [Qi] <--------
